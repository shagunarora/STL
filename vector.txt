Vectors are sequence containers that have dynamic size. just like arrays 
elements here are stored sequentially so that they can be accessed or traversed
by iterators.To traverse a vector we need a starting and ending position which 
can be done by begin() and end() respectively.

Some of the member functions of vectors are:

1.at(position) : returns the reference to the element at the given position
2.back()       : returns reference to last element
3.begin()      : returns the iterator pointing to first element
4.end()        : returns iterator pointing to element preceding last element
5.clear()      : deletes all the element of vector and returns empty vector
6.empty()      : returns bool true if vector is empty else false
7.erase()      : deletes a single or range of element
8.front()      : returns reference to the front element
9.insert()     : insert element at a given position
10.pop_back()  : removes element from the end
11.push_back()   : insert element at the end
12.resize()    : resize element to new length
13.size()      : returns size of vector
